# Computational Neuroscience

This repository contains code and reports for a graduate-level computational neuroscience course at the University of Tehran.

## Contents

The repository covers the following topics:

- **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Models**: Python implementations and analyses of the LIF neuron model, along with enhanced versions like the Exponential LIF and Adaptive Exponential LIF models.
- **Neural Populations**: Simulates and studies various connectivity structures within spiking neural networks.
- **Neural Encoding**: Implements algorithms for Time-to-First-Spike encoding.
- **Learning**: Models Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Reward-Modulated STDP, exploring weight changes in spiking neural networks.

## Usage

Each topic has its own subdirectory, containing the code and a PDF report that explains the background and results.

To run the code, install [PyMoNNtorch](https://github.com/Ganjtabesh-Lab/PymoNNtorch) and [CoNeX](https://github.com/cnrl/CoNeX)

## About the Course

These projects were developed as part of a graduate-level course on computational neuroscience at the University of Tehran, taught by Dr. Ganjtabesh.

The course explored neural biophysics, synaptic plasticity, network dynamics, and learning, with an emphasis on integrating theory and practical modeling to better understand brain computation.
